**StayManager NG** is a Flutter portfolio demo by Joseph Obaje. Hotel and guest house management with rooms, bookings, check-in/out and billing in Naira. It runs standalone with built-in mock Nigerian data — no server, account, API key or real money is involved. Prices are shown in Naira (₦) where relevant. Payment steps, where shown, are test-mode placeholders only.

## Going live

Use this demo as the front end for a real system: persist data with a local database or your REST API, add authenticated roles, and move payments to a server-verified gateway (for example Paystack) so secrets never ship in the app.
